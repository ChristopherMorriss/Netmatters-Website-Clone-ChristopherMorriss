# Netmatters Website Clone
The repository for the Netmatters Website Clone Assessement <br>
Contains two pages: Home page and Contact Us page <br>
Contact Page: <br>
The submission form stores the data entered from all six input fields into a database which contains six different table columns<br>
The database table columns are: your_name, company, email, telephone, your_messsage and marketing (refers to the checkbox) <br>
The submission requires a database for storage but the .env is not contained in this repository <br>
If you want to test it out yourself you will need to create your own database <br>
Home Page: <br>
Contains the design and the basic functionality of the Netmatters home page but all links except any named "Contact Us" 
link to the top of the page instead of the page with information related to the link name
